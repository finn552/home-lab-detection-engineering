# Offensive Setup – Anonymous Linux VM

## Objective
To create a virtual machine designed for anonymous offensive testing.

## Configuration
- **Base OS**: Kali Linux (VMWare)
- **Network**: NAT with VPN (Mullvad) tunnel
- **Tools Pre-installed**:
  - Nmap
  - Metasploit
  - Gobuster
  - Proxychains

## Goal
Used for attack simulations against internal VMs within isolated lab — no real external targeting. Ensures isolated, non-leaky testing for red team skill practice.
