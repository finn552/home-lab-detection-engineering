## üìç Notes
- These are simulated logs for demonstration purposes.
- Alerts were "generated" through mock Suricata rules triggered during controlled testing.
- Each alert maps to a corresponding attack scenario in the lab.

**Next Step:** Correlate alerts with PCAP logs and analyst playbooks to improve detection fidelity.
